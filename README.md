1) **Introduction**: Variables, pinMode's, and digitalWrite function.

2) **LED Binary Counter**: A bit counter.

3) **Analog Read and Write**: using the analogWrite and analogRead functions to measure and send voltages. PMW (~) and ANALOG IN pins.

4) **Serial Print**: String concatenation of different data types. Better if data types are initially defined instead of "..." in print command. Baud Rates.

5) **Potentiometer**: Potentiometer voltage regulation. If statements. A simple project with potentiometer analogRead and RBY LED digitalWrite.

6) **Dimmable LED**: Controlling LED brightness by adjusting potentiometer. Converting potentiometer's 0 to 1023 bytes to an analog signal's 0 to 255 bytes.

7) **For Loop**: Using for loop to blink LED a certain number of times.
